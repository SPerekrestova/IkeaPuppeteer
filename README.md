# IkeaPuppeteer

This script has been made in order to help people monitor products' availability in the Ikea shop.

Typical use case:
 - Imagine you have many items in your Ikea shopping cart and you'd like to order all of them at once. 
 - Several small items are not available in your city right now
 - You neither want to remove them nor want to order without them cause it's too expencive to buy them separetly with other delivery
 - You monior Ikea.com every 1 hour waiting for the items to decome available
 - You're tired, you hate Ikea

And here comes a solution! 

You can use this script to automate this hourly routine. Just specify your parameters in the `config.yml` file and forget about monitoring. You will recieve a notification to the your Telegram once neccesary items become available.

Enjoy!
